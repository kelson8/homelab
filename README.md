# My homelab
This repository will have most of the configs for my homelab, once i get everything setup.

## To do: 
 * Move docker projects into a docker folder
 * Put any custom configs that doesn't contain sensitive info under linux_configs folder
 * Add install guides for my systems as future references (vm's and physical, linux and windows)
